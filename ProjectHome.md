There are many calendar/memo applications for Android. But all of them are time based. You can set a memo in specific date and specific time period. When it reached to the time, it gives an alert. But the GeoMemo is little bit different. Its location based. You can set a memo and mark it on a map. When you reach to that location, it will give the alert. It’s independent from the time. Also another feature of GeoMemo is it can change the phone’s silent/loud state according to your location.
As an example, you can set a memo on your university by setting the phone’s state as silent. Then you can set another memo at your home by setting the state as loud. Then when you go to the university, your phone will be automatically silent. When you go to your home, it will be automatically loud. Also you can define the valid scope of a memo. If you set the scope as 10 meters for a memo, the memo will valid for 10 meter radius circle from the defined point.

Also you can use GeoMemo as an innovative reminder app. If you need to buy something from a shop when you go home, you can set a memo near the shop. Then when you reach to that location, GeoMemo will remind your task.

GeoMemo uses the GPS receiver of your Android phone to find your current location. It contains a service and the application. The application provides the user interface to set and delete memos. The service always runs in background. It checks your location in every 4 minutes. When the distance between your current geo location and the memo point is less than the defined radius, it will alert and changes the phone's state.
